            The philosophical short story "The Ones Who Walk Away From Omelas" by
            Ursula Le Guin tells about a fictional utopian city - Omelas - where the
            happiness of its citizens is maintained by the suffering of a child.
          </p>
          <p> The story has many interpretations. It could be condemning utilitarianism.
            Or Omelas and the child could be an allegory for humans' neglect of moral
            questions in exchange for a bustling, seemingly perfect life.
          </p>
          <p> To reflect the message that Le Guin was sending in her story, I wanted the
            colors of the visuals to become duller as the viewer STAYs in
            Omelas. If the viewer decides to WALK AWAY, returning to the welcome page might
            give a clue related to the title of the story.
